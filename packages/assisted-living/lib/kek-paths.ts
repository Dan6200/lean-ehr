// This file centralizes KEK paths to be used by server-side code and Firebase Functions.
// KEK paths are always read from process.env, as they are expected to be set
// in deployed environments (Server Actions, Functions).

// IMPORTANT: These environment variables must be configured during deployment
// (e.g., via firebase functions:config:set or gcloud run jobs deploy --set-env-vars).

// Add other KEKs here if needed
// export const KEK_RESPONDER_PATH = process.env.KEK_RESPONDER_PATH!
